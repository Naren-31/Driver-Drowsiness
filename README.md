learning to enhance road safety. 
• It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and advanced 
computer vision techniques for real-time analysis of drowsiness signs 
like eye closure and yawning. 
• The system triggers immediate alerts, and performance is rigorously 
tested. 
• Seamless integration into in-vehicle technology is a focus, 
emphasizing practicality and road safety improvement.

Problem Statement :
 The project's primary objective is to tackle the problem of driver drowsiness, a significant road safety concern.It aims to develop a methodology that can detect and predict drowsiness at early 
 stages by utilizing a combination of physical and physiological variables. The project leverages AI techniques and integrates the Google Vision API for Android to analyze these variables in real-time. 
 A feasibility test will be conducted to assess the accuracy and performance of the proposed methodology.
